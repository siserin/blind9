IPv6 addresses (AAAA)
---------------------

IPv6 addresses are 128-bit identifiers for interfaces and sets of
interfaces which were introduced in the DNS to facilitate scalable
Internet routing. There are three types of addresses: *Unicast*, an
identifier for a single interface; *Anycast*, an identifier for a set of
interfaces; and *Multicast*, an identifier for a set of interfaces. Here
we describe the global Unicast address scheme. For more information, see
RFC 3587, "Global Unicast Address Format."

IPv6 unicast addresses consist of a *global routing prefix*, a *subnet
identifier*, and an *interface identifier*.

The global routing prefix is provided by the upstream provider or ISP,
and (roughly) corresponds to the IPv4 *network* section of the address
range. The subnet identifier is for local subnetting, much the same as
subnetting an IPv4 /16 network into /24 subnets. The interface
identifier is the address of an individual interface on a given network;
in IPv6, addresses belong to interfaces rather than to machines.

The subnetting capability of IPv6 is much more flexible than that of
IPv4: subnetting can be carried out on bit boundaries, in much the same
way as Classless InterDomain Routing (CIDR), and the DNS PTR
representation ("nibble" format) makes setting up reverse zones easier.

The Interface Identifier must be unique on the local link, and is
usually generated automatically by the IPv6 implementation, although it
is usually possible to override the default setting if necessary. A
typical IPv6 address might look like:
``2001:db8:201:9:a00:20ff:fe81:2b32``

IPv6 address specifications often contain long strings of zeros, so the
architects have included a shorthand for specifying them. The double
colon (``::``) indicates the longest possible string of zeros that can
fit, and can be used only once in an address.

Request for Comments (RFCs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Specification documents for the Internet protocol suite, including the
DNS, are published as part of the Request for Comments (RFCs) series of
technical notes. The standards themselves are defined by the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Engineering Steering
Group (IESG). RFCs can be obtained online via FTP at:

`ftp://www.isi.edu/in-notes/RFCxxxx.txt <ftp://www.isi.edu/in-notes/>`__

(where xxxx is the number of the RFC). RFCs are also available via the

Internet Drafts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Internet Drafts (IDs) are rough-draft working documents of the Internet
Engineering Task Force. They are, in essence, RFCs in the preliminary
stages of development. Implementors are cautioned not to regard IDs as
archival, and they should not be quoted or cited in any formal documents
unless accompanied by the disclaimer that they are "works in progress."
IDs have a lifespan of six months after which they are deleted unless
updated by their authors.
