DESCRIPTION
===========

``rndc-confgen`` generates configuration files for ``rndc``. It can be
used as a convenient alternative to writing the ``rndc.conf`` file and
the corresponding ``controls`` and ``key`` statements in ``named.conf``
by hand. Alternatively, it can be run with the ``-a`` option to set up a
``rndc.key`` file and avoid the need for a ``rndc.conf`` file and a
``controls`` statement altogether.

OPTIONS
=======

-a
   Do automatic ``rndc`` configuration. This creates a file ``rndc.key``
   in ``/etc`` (or whatever ``sysconfdir`` was specified as when BIND
   was built) that is read by both ``rndc`` and ``named`` on startup.
   The ``rndc.key`` file defines a default command channel and
   authentication key allowing ``rndc`` to communicate with ``named`` on
   the local host with no further configuration.

   Running ``rndc-confgen -a`` allows BIND 9 and ``rndc`` to be used as
   drop-in replacements for BIND 8 and ``ndc``, with no changes to the
   existing BIND 8 ``named.conf`` file.

   If a more elaborate configuration than that generated by
   ``rndc-confgen -a`` is required, for example if rndc is to be used
   remotely, you should run ``rndc-confgen`` without the ``-a`` option
   and set up a ``rndc.conf`` and ``named.conf`` as directed.

-A algorithm
   Specifies the algorithm to use for the TSIG key. Available choices
   are: hmac-md5, hmac-sha1, hmac-sha224, hmac-sha256, hmac-sha384 and
   hmac-sha512. The default is hmac-sha256.

-b keysize
   Specifies the size of the authentication key in bits. Must be between
   1 and 512 bits; the default is the hash size.

-c keyfile
   Used with the ``-a`` option to specify an alternate location for
   ``rndc.key``.

-h
   Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
   ``rndc-confgen``.

-k keyname
   Specifies the key name of the rndc authentication key. This must be a
   valid domain name. The default is ``rndc-key``.

-p port
   Specifies the command channel port where ``named`` listens for
   connections from ``rndc``. The default is 953.

-s address
   Specifies the IP address where ``named`` listens for command channel
   connections from ``rndc``. The default is the loopback address
   127.0.0.1.

-t chrootdir
   Used with the ``-a`` option to specify a directory where ``named``
   will run chrooted. An additional copy of the ``rndc.key`` will be
   written relative to this directory so that it will be found by the
   chrooted ``named``.

-u user
   Used with the ``-a`` option to set the owner of the ``rndc.key`` file
   generated. If ``-t`` is also specified only the file in the chroot
   area has its owner changed.

EXAMPLES
========

To allow ``rndc`` to be used with no manual configuration, run

``rndc-confgen -a``

To print a sample ``rndc.conf`` file and corresponding ``controls`` and
``key`` statements to be manually inserted into ``named.conf``, run

``rndc-confgen``
