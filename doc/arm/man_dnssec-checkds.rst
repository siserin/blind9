dnssec-checkds - DNSSEC delegation consistency checking tool
------------------------------------------------------------

Synopsis
~~~~~~~~

:program:`dnssec-checkds` [**-d** dig path] [**-D** dsfromkey path] [**-f** file] [**-l** domain] [**-s** file] {zone}

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

``dnssec-checkds`` verifies the correctness of Delegation Signer (DS) or
DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV) resource records for keys in a
specified zone.

Options
~~~~~~~

**-f** file
   If a ``file`` is specified, then the zone is read from that file to
   find the DNSKEY records. If not, then the DNSKEY records for the zone
   are looked up in the DNS.

**-l** domain
   Check for a DLV record in the specified lookaside domain, instead of
   checking for a DS record in the zone's parent.

**-s** file
   Specifies a prepared dsset file, such as would be generated by
   ``dnssec-signzone``, to use as a source for the DS RRset instead of
   querying the parent.

**-d** dig path
   Specifies a path to a ``dig`` binary. Used for testing.

**-D** dsfromkey path
   Specifies a path to a ``dnssec-dsfromkey`` binary. Used for testing.
