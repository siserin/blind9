longer and more detailed YAML format is used instead.

Options

   After printing the ``dnstap`` data, print the text form of the DNS
   message that was encapsulated in the ``dnstap`` frame.

**-x**
   After printing the ``dnstap`` data, print a hex dump of the wire form
   of the DNS message that was encapsulated in the ``dnstap`` frame.

**-y**
   Print ``dnstap`` data in a detailed YAML format.
